There are two types of escaping in Describe - escape sequences and escape groups.

1. Escape sequences
An ESCAPE SEQUENCE consists of a backslash "\" and a command character (key word). For example:


	some escape sequence ->
	
		an escape sequence - "\<", 
		another escape sequence - "\>", 
		another escape sequence - "\[", 
		another escape sequence - "\]", 
		another escape sequence - "\->", 
		another escape sequence - "\;", 
		another escape sequence - "\,";
