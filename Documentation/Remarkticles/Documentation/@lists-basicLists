A list in its simplest form consist of a title, followed by a production arrow "->", followed by 0, one or more elements, delimited by commas "," and terminated by a semicolon ";". For example:


	popular citrus fruits ->

		Orange,
		Lemon,
		Grapefruit,
		Pomelo;


Reserved words (aka key words, aka reserved symbols, aka key symbols, aka special characters) in this example are:

	- '->' a "producer" or "production arrow"
	- ',' a "separator"
	- ';' a "terminator"

Those special characters can also be escaped:

	- '\->' an "escaped producer" or "escaped production arrow"
	- '\,' an "escaped separator"
	- '\;' an "escaped terminator"
