	3-2. LINK HEAP
	The LINK HEAP is enclosed in square brackets.
	A LINK HEAP consists of one or more LINKS, separated by a comma ",".
	For example - "[www.some-url.com/article.htm | Some Url - Article, www.x.com/tod.htm | X Today]"

		3-2-1. LINK
		A LINK might be as simple as a valid URL - "www.some-url.com/article.htm"
		Or it might contain a title, in which case the title is separated by the URL by space and a pipe.
		Very much like the links in MediaWiki markup. For example - "www.some-url.com/article.htm | Some Url - Article",
		where "Some Url - Article" is the title.
