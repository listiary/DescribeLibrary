A list in its simplest form consist of a title, followed by a production arrow "->", followed by 0, one or more elements, delimited by commas "," and terminated by a semicolon ";". For example:


	popular citrus fruits ->

		Orange,
		Lemon,
		Grapefruit,
		Pomelo;

1. Nested statements
It can be convenient to have nested statements, instead of having to rely on simple statements:
"
pop culture <ThNOSwjc> ->
	
	baseball metaphors for sex <wXfQtZzR> ->

		First base <RVKlIfMw>,
		Second base <8XKdfk4C>,
		Third base <yTq1MDc9>,
		Home run <xuuAfH6r>;
	
	some other list <e4EqNqlx> ->
	
		Item A <UaQ5lG6M> ->
		
			lorem <bc8lfOzH>,
			ipsum <s3hvwgXr>;

		Item B <ccbZt8FN>,
		Item C <3KyYvMQ0>;
