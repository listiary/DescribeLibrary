2. Locked entries
A mechanism for data protection of some private lists in the DESCRIBE markup is desireable. This might work as follows:
Files can be encrypted using some simetric cipher and a user-provided password. Those encrypted files can then be 
refferenced in any non-protected lists via a "locked entry". A LOCKED ENTRY is like a regular entry which, instead
of a regular ITEMTAG han an encrypted one, or CRYPTOTAG.

	2-1. CRYPTOTAG
	A CRYPTOTAG starts with "~<" and ends with ">". A cryptotag contains cryptostring
	that might be stlit on multiple lines or indented - so whitespaces are ignored inside
	the CRYPTOTAG.
	
	2-2. Presentation
	When rendered, locked entries should be presented in a fashion similar to regular entries, but in a way that
	makes it obvious it is a locked entry user can click on. After clicking on a locked entry, the user is asked
	for a password, and upon providing it, the decription process can start.
	
	2-3. Decription process
	Note that the specific implementation of the encryption algorithm and the decryption process is not given here.
	The cryptostring is decrypted using the user-provided password. 
	The first n characters are examined, and if those contain a given word, the decryption is deemed successful
	and the other part of the decrypted text is the actual filename and tag entry, padded with a zero terminator 
	and some random data.

An example of a locked entri follows:
