	are we going to be preserving new lines in entries, use escapes or use double new line like in wiki
	same goes for whitespaces and leading and thrilling whitespaces

Leading and trailing whitespaces are ignored, while inside statements they act as delimiter, although
their count and type is ignored - that is " " equals "    " equals "\t". 
New lines count is also ignored - "\n" equals "\n\n\n".
