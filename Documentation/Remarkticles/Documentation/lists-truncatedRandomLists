"Truncated Random List" or simply a "Random List" is a list that shows few random elements, while others remain hidden.

For example, a user might have a list of 50 or so favorite breakfast dishes, named "what's for breakfast", and he might want only 3 randomly picked ones to be displayed, so he can easily choose one for the day. User might also want to get another three sugestions if he isn't happy with either one of the tree, and on ocasion, he might want to view all the items in the list anyway. So those lists should have a way to be refreshed - in order to display new randomly picked elements, and have a way to be expanded, as well.

- First way, for either of these actions, might be via a context menu - when right clicked on the list.
- Another way is with a symbol at the end of the text - for example "what's for breakfast (R)" - where "(R)" is the clickable symbol, represented by some unicode symbol, or an image.
- Yet another way is to have those clickable symbols/icons under all the visible elements of the list.
