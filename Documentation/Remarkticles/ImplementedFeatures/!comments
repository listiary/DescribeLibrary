Comments in Describe are like comments in C++ or C#

There are two types of comments in Describe - single line comments and multi-line comments. Single line comments start with double forward slashes ("//") and end with new line ("\n" or "\r\n" ). Multi-line comments start with a froward slash and a star ("/*") and end with a star and a forward slash ("*/"). Comments in Describe cannot be nested.
