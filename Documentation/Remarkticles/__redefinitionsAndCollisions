5. Redefinitions and collisions
Redefinitions are something bad and undesireable.
This happens if there is an ITEM TAG COLLISION, or an accidental redefinition.

	5-1. ITEM TAG COLLISION
	ITEM TAG COLLISION happens when short ITEM TAGS are used and accidentally a newly generated
	ITEM TAG ID matches a previous one. Of course there is a possibility of this happening with IDS
	of any length, but it is much more likely to happen with 2 character IDS, for example, instead of
	8 character IDS, where chances are astronomical.
	
	5-2. ACCIDENTAL REDEFINITION
	ACCIDENTAL REDEFINITION happens when, for example, someone copies a previously defined entry in a
	production, including the LITERAL (and possibly the LINK HEAP), instead of just copying the ITEM TAG of the TERMIN.

	5-3. CONSEQUENCES
	REDEFINITIONS can be reported by the editor/interpreter as errors or might be left as is,
	but the problem is that if interpreting of code passes through the redefinition first, the displayed
	result will show the redefinition instead. Also, if the definition LITERAL is later edited it gets 
	only more confusing later on.
