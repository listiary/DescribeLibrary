3. Root termins
A TERMIN that starts with an exclimation mark "!" is a ROOT TERMIN.
When a ROOT DOCUMENT is displayed, the ROOT TERMINS become the root entries 
upon which the lists are built. Also, if an ITEM TAG only refferences a filename,
the ROOT TERMINS in that file become elemets(s) in the list. Using ROOT TERMINS also makes the
markup more readable. If no ROOT TERMIN is used, the first production's left side TERMIN 
or the first definition is considered to be the ROOT TERMIN.
