There are two ways to write directives - full notation and short notation.

When using full notation, directives are just lists that are first in the file, and have a given keyword - like "utilizing" for head. This allows directives to be gruped. For example:

	utilizing -> 
	
		basics,
		locks;

Which is the same as:

	utilizing -> basics;
	utilizing -> locks;


The short notation, on the other hand ommits the production arror and allows only for single liners to be used. For example:

	utilizing basics;
	utilizing locks;
	unplug comments;
